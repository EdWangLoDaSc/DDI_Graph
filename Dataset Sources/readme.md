# Dataset Description

## ChCh-Miner_durgbank-chem-chem.tsv Overview

This dataset, provided by the Stanford SNAP group, contains detailed information on drug-drug interactions that have received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration. Distinct from previously described bipartite datasets, this dataset is structured as a mono-partite network. Within this framework, a drug-drug interaction is defined as a scenario where the pharmacological effect of one drug is modified by the presence of another drug.
